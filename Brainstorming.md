**Step 2a:** Top 3 Ideas Selected for Evaluation

After reviewing all nine ideas, the group voted and selected these top three apps to evaluate:

* MovieMood

**Step 2b:** Evaluation of the Top 3 Ideas

Using the required criteria: Mobile, Story, Market, Habit, Scope

 1. MovieMood – Mood-Based Movie Recommendations
**Criteria	Evaluation**
**Mobile:**	Strong mobile experience with interactive UI, scrolling, posters, and mood buttons.

**Market:**	Large audience: college students, movie lovers, anyone with streaming apps.
**Habit:**	Medium–high. Users may check it often to find something to watch.
**Scope:**	Clear MVP: choose a mood → display recommended movie list using an API. Very achievable.
 2. HydrateMe – Water Reminder App
**Mobile:**	Great mobile use case with notifications and daily tracking.
**Story:**	Easy to explain: stay hydrated and build healthy habits.
**Market:**	Appeals to students, athletes, and health beginners.
